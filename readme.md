1. Are you looking to expand your family? Do you need a new BFF? If so, the UltiMUTT Adoption App. is for you. This app allows you to see dogs that are available for adoption near you(Massachusetts). It will also display the pets current status(availabe, pending adoption), contact information, location, photo and brief description. The user will also be able to create a favorites list and write personal notes/comments on each pet.
